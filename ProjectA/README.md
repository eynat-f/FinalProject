# Project A - Drone Audio Database Assembly

This project focuses on assembling a database of synchronized drone audio recordings and corresponding positional logs.
The dataset was recorded during controlled drone flights along predefined paths and serves as the foundation of our classification process in Project B.

Note: The code in this repository is provided for reference only and is not intended to be executed. The main runnable code is located in [`Project B`](../ProjectB/README.md).

## Project Structure

- [`project_code/`](project_code/README.md) - Main code used for collecting audio and positional data during drone flights.
- [`recordings/`](recordings/README.md) - Raw full-flight audio recordings and their corresponding logs and plots.
