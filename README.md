# FinalProject

This project is divided into two main parts:

## Project A – Drone Audio Database Assembly
Focuses on assembling a database of synchronized drone audio recordings and corresponding positional logs.
The dataset was recorded during controlled drone flights along predefined paths and serves as the foundation of our classification process in Project B.

## Project B – Drone Movement Classification
Focuses on classifying drone movement types (ascending, descending, hovering, moving away/towards the microphone and turning), using only an audio recordings database.
The repository contains both the code used throughout the experimental process and the finalized version for reproducing results or further exploration.

As the main body of our work was conducted in Project B, we recommend exploring it in detail.
